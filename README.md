# KEEMI-iOS
KEEMI is a mobile application which utilizes question-driven learning to build the bridge from information consumption to keeping information in mind.

## Students, Trainees & inquisitive minds
use KEEMI to center the valuable knowledge that they want to keep in mind. To reach this goal the KEEMI app supports such users by delivering:
- Linking facts and memorable questions
- Attaching further reading references such as Wikipedia articles or PDF-files
- Adding personal notes for additional information or memory hooks
- Summary and information retrieval of fatcs and questions

## Teachers, Authors & Experts
create question catalogs as an add-on to their own products or services. Once they've created a catalog we provide:
- Free tools which helps their customers to memorize the information they provide
- Another possibilty to promote their products or services
- A file based product which can be sold on their websites or a third party digital content store
- A way to improve the relationships with their customers
